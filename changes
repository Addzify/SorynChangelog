📢 Changelog 10/21/25 — Soryn‘s Lobby Manager v3.3.5

🛠 Improvements & Fixes

⚙️ **NEW** Increased Movement Timings – Adjusted internal movement timing intervals to prevent bots from being kicked during extended sessions. Movement stability and synchronization are now more consistent across all tabs.

🔄 Movement Sync Properly Fixed – Movement synchronization somehow broke again; this update ensures it now properly persists between all tabs.
